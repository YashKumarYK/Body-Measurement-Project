# Body-Measurement-Project
A computer vision-based project that can estimate the measurement of the entire body from
an image.
* Utilized the technologies involving Python, OpenCV, and Mediapipe.
* Used the techniques including image segmentation, contour detection and pixel per metric ratio

`Image Segmentation` Image segmentation is a method in which a digital image is broken down into various subgroups called Image segments which helps in reducing the complexity of the image to make further processing or analysis of the image simpler.

`Contour Detection` Contours detection is a process can be explained simply as a curve joining all the continuous points (along with the boundary), having same colour or intensity. The contours are a useful tool for shape analysis and object detection and recognition.
